Easy attendance using Android Studio
# ABSTRACT
The Smart Attendance System using Login Access feature in Android app development  is a system that allows educational institutions to easily manage attendance records. The  system aims to reduce the manual effort required for attendance management by automating  the process. The app is designed for use by both students and teachers, with different levels  of access and functionality. The app is built using Android Studio and is integrated with  Firebase authentication for secure login access. The system utilizes GPS location tracking  and QR code scanning to record student attendance in real-time. Teachers can use the app  to take attendance, view attendance records, and send notifications to absent students.  Students can view their attendance records and receive notifications about their attendance  status. The system also features a dashboard that provides a summary of attendance records for each class, as well as detailed reports on individual student attendance. This feature is  especially useful for schools and colleges, as it provides an overview of attendance patterns  and helps identify potential issues that may require attention. Overall, the Smart Attendance  System using Login Access feature in Android app development offers a user-friendly and  efficient way for schools and colleges to manage attendance records, while also providing  valuable insights into attendance patterns and trends. The system comprises two parts: the  Android mobile application and the backend server. The mobile application is developed for  the user to mark their attendance, while the backend server is responsible for storing and  managing the attendance data. The mobile application uses the device camera to scan the  QR code or capture the user's facial features to mark their attendance. The attendance data  is then sent to the backend server where it is stored in a database. The system has several  advantages over traditional attendance management systems. It reduces the workload on the  administration team, saving time and resources. It also eliminates the possibility of  fraudulent attendance marking, as the system uses modern technologies to ensure that only  authorized users can mark their attendance. The system provides real-time attendance data,  which enables the administration team to track attendance trends and identify areas for  improvement.

Title: Wi-Fi Hotspot based Attendance Application using Android Smartphone 
Management is new area for managing the business and human resource tasks that offers  services by advance communication technologies and smart devices. Attendance is a hectic  and time-consuming process in our daily lives. To resolve this, we proposed and developed  a fully automated android smartphone application. It marks and tracks attendance as  mManagement solution with an additional Wi-Fi hotspot feature. The objective of our  application is to optimize the performance of taking attendance in an efficient and effective  way. It reminds the students/attendees about timings of upcoming class via broadcasting a  notification to attendees of that specific class. The app not only notes the attendance, but  also track the presence of attendee, by automatically marking their attendance at predefined  intervals. To evaluate our application, we tested the app in small conference halls, and it  out-performed many existing android applications, especially applications based on  Bluetooth connectivity. Our app works over the coverage area of maximum 24.5 meters  radius in closed area, by marking attendance of 10 attendees simultaneously.

Title: Android based advanced attendance vigilance system using wireless network  with fusion of bio-metric fingerprint authentication 
In this digital era, different organizations have started taking attendance using biometric  fingerprint authentication. This will keep the track of employee's attendance but the question  arises if the employee is fully present at his/her workplace after giving attendance. In this  modern era of digitalization, it is seen that after giving attendance a huge number of  employees escape away from their workplace and do their personal job in the office time.  This paper focuses on a smart attendance system where an android device will be used as a  smart ID card. A mobile application is developed in Java to ensure the attendance of an  individual employee using bio-metric fingerprint authentication. In addition, the entire  working place will be a Wi-Fi zone. So, the connection or disconnection of the android  device (Smart ID card) to the router will determine whether an employee is present in the working place or not. A counter will be there into the system to count the total amount of  time an employee spends in the working place.

Tracking of attendance is a ubiquitous task in many institutions and during organised events.  This, along with subsequent management of collected data can be a cumbersome activity  that requires significant time and effort, from all involved parties. Tracking and managing  student attendance during lectures and exams is an especially important instance of that task.  Automated attendance management systems devised in the literature differ in applied  technological solutions and features. However, many of these lack some features that would  make them particularly useful for the task of student attendance management. This paper  proposes the design of an automatic system tailored for the tracking and management of  student attendance data. The design incorporates three main components that interact to  deliver a seamless user experience. The key element is the utilisation of simple beacons,  which make the system cost-effective and easy to use. Combining them with a mobile  platform and a web service enables versatile attendance tracking. Periodic detection of the  nearby beacons with authenticated server-side logic makes the proposed design unique in  terms of addressing common attendance tracking issues. Also, the design is open for future  integration of sophisticated data analysis modules.

Title: Smart attendance using deep learning and computer vision 
Attendance is an essential part of daily classroom evaluation. Traditional classroom follows  a manual attendance marking system, i.e., calling a student's names or by forwarding an  attendance sheet. This process is both time-consuming and error-prone, i.e., student proxy,  etc. Hence a face recognition based smart classroom attendance management system using  computer vision and deep learning implemented on a Raspberry Pi has been proposed. It has  been proposed to mount a camera at the top of the blackboard so that the students are visible  while they are sitting down. A face detection algorithm followed by face recognition has  been used to mark the attendance of the detected student.
